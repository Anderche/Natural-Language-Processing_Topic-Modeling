### BACKGROUND: 

TM can help recommend content to website visitors. Instead of relying on visitors filtering, TM can be combined with Recommendation Systems to personalize content for site visitors, placing the most relevant content on visitor's screen via a simple keyword matching approach for each visitor, later changing to a collaborative matching approach for groups of readers with similar interests. News outlets can use topic modeling in order to: identify topics in articles AND identify topic preferences amongst its readers, THEN compare the two to find the best match for a visitor.

The following code implementaion models Daily news articles in order to quickly assess the central themes behind a given day's news articles.
